## 2024-09-09 Initial Idea
Researched the LED strips and what kind of heart rate sensor we would have to use, 

## 2024-09-16 Parts research
Looked into the heart rate sensor and what kind of signal it would require. Also looked into the ESP-32 chip. 

## 2024-09-23 Design Document work
We started working on the design document. Worked on the power management subsystem for the wearable parts and the LED control subsystem as well as their requirement verification parts. 

## 2024-09-30 Proposal Regrade work
Changed the format of proposal with TA feedback about high level requirements. 

## 2024-10-7 Design Document feedback
Presented to Taâ€™s and professor and got feedback on systems and to be more specific with the high level requirements. Also considered how the heart rate sensor would be placed on a users hand properly. 

## 2024-10-14 to 2024-10-28 Initial PCB work
We finalized the schematic and started working on specific parts. I worked on the micrchophone, LEDs, and USB components of the PCB design. 

## 2024-11-6 PCB update
Fixed some errors in the schematic and updated the PCB to include other parts such as the antenna and crystal components.
