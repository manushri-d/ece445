#2024-09-02 Initial Idea
Did some preliminary research on the idea.

#2024-09-18 Submitted Proposal
Fully fleshed out what we wanted to do and how were going to approach it


#2024-10-02 Submitted Design Document
Found the components that were requried to design the idea and then how we were going 
incorperate both systems


#2024-10-08 Design Review
Got valuable feedback from the professor, TA, and peers on what was unclear in our design document and what to change in our overall desgin so that it is clearer and easier to find.

#2024-10-28 Third Round Order
Created the schematic for the wearable part in which we needed to find out how to create the heart rate sensor and connect it to the ESP32

#2024-11-04 Got the PCB reviewed and realized that we need a way to program the PCB, and find away to support bluetooth so we added an antena. Also realized that it was infeasible to make the mounted subsystem powered by the wall, so instead powered via usb-c

#2024-11-08 Started looking into getting modules so that we can breadboard it incase the PCB doesn't come in time. We are already using the MAX9814 module, so we just need to get the the MAX30104 and the ESP32-C3 dev-kit.

#2024-11-17 Parts all arrived and we started breadboarding. Submitted the final round PCB order with a programming circuit and everything is now powered with the USB-C connector.

#2024-12-03 Bread board is assmebled, but the code is finnicky. The leds don't seem to be changing colors. Looked more into example circuits and turns out we are using the wrong transitors and that they were rated for a higher voltage, which we weren't providing.

#2024-12-04 Overall this was a great experince. It enabled me to use programs I never had before. It was frustrating at times, but the end product was fun to play around with and it opened the door for more ideas.
