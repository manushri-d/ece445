## 2024-09-09 Initial Idea
Did some preliminary research on the idea. Looked into how to modify led lights, and if it is possible to take external inputs.

## 2024-09-16 Parts research
Looked into ESP32-C3 to be a big component of project. This would work with bluetooth and sending the data from wearable system to mounted system.

## 2024-09-23 Design Document work
Started working on the design document. Created a visual aid to show how we would use both microphone and heart rate sensor to then be computed and come up with an output

## 2024-09-30 Proposal Regrade work
Changed entire format of document to be more professional. Did research into parts needed, and reevaluated use of them in the circuit schematics. Also redrew visual aids to work with TA feedback.

## 2024-10-7 Design Document feedback
After receiving feedback on the design document, we have moved on to modifying our priorities. Both TAs, Prof and Peer feedback are useful to change up some things. Working on solidifying components for both wearable and mounted subsystem

## 2024-10-14 to 2024-10-28 Initial PCB work
Finalized circuit schematic and started working on PCB. Split the PCB work in round robin style, with each person working on it at one time. We have 2 PCBs, but I mostly worked on the wearable component. Successfully made order by audit

## 2024-11-6 PCB update
Realized we were lacking flash, crystal, and antenna, all crucial parts of the PCB. I started redoing the wearable system circuit schematic, and did initial connections for the PCB aspect of it. Also organized it to make it seem more professional and easy to follow. Made order after a long day!
