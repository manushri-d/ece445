Did some preliminary research on the idea.

#2024-09-18 Submitted Proposal
Fully fleshed out what we wanted to do and how were going to approach it


#2024-10-02 Submitted Design Document
Found the components that were requried to design the idea and then how we were going 
incorperate both systems


#2024-10-08 Design Review
Got valuable feedback from the professor, TA, and peers on what was unclear in our design document and what to change in our overall desgin so that it is clearer and easier to find.

#2024-10-28 Third Round Order
Created the schematic for the wearable part in which we needed to find out how to create the heart rate sensor and connect it to the ESP32

#2024-11-04 Got the PCB reviewed and realized that we need a way to program the PCB, and find away to support bluetooth so we added an antena. Also realized that it was infeasible to make the mounted subsystem powered by the wall, so instead powered via usb-c
